## VIP-05: Deletion

This event is used to delete key, role or other resources of a profile. It can also be used to revoke a delegation.

**Kind: 3: `delete`**

**Tags:**

- k for key, followed by `key_name`.
- r for role, followed by `role_name`.
- d for delegation, followed by `delegatee_rootkey`.

**Content:** The content field is used to give the reason for the deletion. It can also be left empty.

**Example:**
```
{
  "kind": 3,
  "rootkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded rootkey of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["k", "asset"],
    ["r", "manager"],
  ],
  "content": "Reason for the deletion (can be empty)",
  ...other fields
}
```

**Notes:**
- When a delegation is deleted, the deletion event time stamp MUST be recorded for that delegation. The time stamp becomes the actual `valid_until` time of that delegation.
- When querying the validity period of a delegation, the deletion event of that delegation MUST be checked.
