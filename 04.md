## VIP-04: Role

This event is used to create and update the roles of an entity.

**Role** can be any personnel or sub-entity that belongs to the main entity. A role is represented by a rootkey. For now we only support rootkey in the form of a zkID DID or an ETH address (automatically prefixed with did:zk:). The rootkey format  (prefix and length) will be checked when a relay receives the role event. If the format check fails, the event will be discarded by the server and it will NOT be stored in Arweave. 

**Kind: 2: `set_role`**

**Tags:** 
- n for the role_name.
- r for the role_rootkey.

**Content:** comments for this role setup. 

**Example:**
```
{
  "kind": 2,
  "rootkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded rootkey of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["n", "event-attester"],
    ["r", "did:zk:0x2F460e375d0C657CfAeF5f486bA72A989ee41234"],
  ],
  "content": "This role is used for community event attestation.",
  ...other fields
}
```
**Notes:**
- When a relay receives a new `set_role` event for the same role of the same rootkey, it will update the rootkey of that role.
- Max length of `role_name` is 200 bytes. The length of `key_content` is 49 bytes.
- `role_name` only supports ASCII lower case letters, numbers - and _. 

**IMPORTANT:** the `key_name` and `role_name` share the same naming space. A `key_name` CANNOT be the same as a `role_name`.
