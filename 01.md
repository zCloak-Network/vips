## VIP-01: Event format, hashing and signatures
This is the basic protocol data structure. Each entity is represented by a rootkey. A rootkey is an ECDSA signing key using secp256k1 curve. For now, the rootkey can be either a [zkID](https://zkid.app) controller key or an Ethereum address prefixed with did:zk:.

This is an example of a root key: did:zk:0x2F460e375d0C657CfAeF5f486bA72A989ee4A506.

We borrow the event data structure from the [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) protocol. The event data structure will be modified to use Keccak256 hash for event id calculation. An example event looks like this.
```json
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded keccak256 of the the serialized event data>
  "rootkey": <rootkey of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": <integer>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of another event>],
    ["r", <rootkey of an entity>],
    ... // other kinds of tags may be included later
  ],
  "content": <arbitrary string>,
  "sig": <signature using ECDSA on the keccak256 hash of the serialized event data, not the same as the "id" field.>,
  "protocol": "eth-nostr"
}
```

To obtain the event.id, we keccak256 the serialized event. The serialization is done over the UTF-8 JSON-serialized string (with no white space or line breaks) of the following structure:
```json
[
  0,
  <rootkey, as a (lowercase) hex string>,
  <created_at, as a number>,
  <kind, as a number>,
  <tags, as an array of arrays of non-null strings>,
  <content, as a string>
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: the contents to be signed is different from the id field as done in Nostr. We follow the EIP-191 standard and use the personal_sign method for event signature. This way, users can use a regular Ethereum wallet such as Metamask to sign the event message.
The content to be signed for each event is:
```
"\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(message) + event.id
```
