## VIP-03: Key

This event is used to create and update the keys of an entity.

**Key** can be any cryptographic public keys or addresses for e.g. receiving funds or anchoring smart contract/NFTs. The user submitted keys will NOT be checked for validity atm. 
In the future, we can add a tag called `verified` to include proof of key verification in case this is needed.

**Kind: 1: `set_key`**

**Tags:**
- n for `key_name`.
- a for `key_address`.

**Content:** comments for this key setup. 

**Example:**
```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "rootkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded rootkey of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["n", "eth-nft"],
    ["a", "0x123456375d0C657CfAeF5f486bA72A9891234566"],
  ],
  "content": "This is the Ethereum smart contract address of our official NFT.",
  ...other fields
}
```

**Notes:**
- When a relay receives a new `set_key` event for the same key of the same rootkey, it will update the `key_address` of that key.
- Max length of `key_name` and `key_address` is 200 bytes each. 
- `key_name` only supports ASCII lower case letters, numbers, - and _. 

**IMPORTANT:** the `key_name` and `role_name` share the same naming space. A `key_name` CANNOT be the same as a `role_name`.
