## VIP-02: Metadata

This event is used to create and update the metadata of an entity.

**Metadata** includes entity name, introduction texts and logo.

**Kind: 0: `set_metadata`**

**Tags:**
By default, an entity can only operate on its own metadata. So the rootkey tag will not be used.

**Content:** The content is set to a stringified JSON object {name: <entity name>, about: <introduction texts>, picture: <url, string>} describing the entity who created the event. When a relay receives a new set_metadata event from the same rootkey, it will update the metadata in its entity profile.

  Example:
```
{
  "kind": 0,
  "rootkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded rootkey of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
  ],
  "content": {name: <entity name>, about: <introduction texts>, picture: <url, string>}",
  ...other fields
}
```
