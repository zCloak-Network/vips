## VIP-06: Delegation 
This event is used to delegate the right of verifiable credential attestation to a rootkey. **Delegator** is the party who initiates this delegation. **Delegatee** is the party who will perform attestation on behalf of the delegator. 

**Kind: 4: `delegation`**

**Tags:**

- r for `delegatee_rootkey`.
- c for `cType`, followed by the cType hash of the VC. A special c value is "all", meaning this role is authorized to make attestations for all cTypes for this entity.
- from for `valid_from`. Format: unix timestamp in seconds. This is the starting time of this delegation. If left unspecified, the current system time will be used. This field MUST NOT be left empty.
- until for `valid_until`. Format: unix timestamp in seconds. This is the ending time of this delegation. If left unspecified, it means "always valid". 

**Content:** The content field is used to give the reason for the delegation. It can also be left empty.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "kind": 4,
  "rootkey": <32-bytes hex-encoded rootkey of the delegator>,
  "tags": [
    ["r", "did:zk:0x2F460e375d0C657CfAeF5f486bA72A989ee41234"],
    ["c", "0x28b5f594de884efe23886d1ade88a48db1670644664780364a7e6a6c55ee5c63"],
    ["c", "0x15ea88be73bd78986a41141fc86497f0cfef4a0d1b5463d100758edca37c546b"],
    ["from": 1675721813],
    ["until": 1675751927],
  ],
  "content": "Reason for the delegation (can be empty)",
  ...other fields
}
```

**Notes:**

- The delegation must always be made with `rootkeys`, not roles. 
- If this `rootkey` is set to be a certain role, the `role_name` will be displayed on the front-end webpage.
